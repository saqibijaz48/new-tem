  # Fix RLS Policies and Authentication Issues

  1. Problem Resolution
    - Fixes infinite recursion in RLS policies
    - Resolves database errors during user registration
    - Enables proper authentication flow

  2. Changes Made
    - Drop problematic recursive policies
    - Create non-recursive is_admin() function
    - Recreate all RLS policies with proper logic
    - Grant necessary permissions

  3. Security
    - Maintains proper access control
    - Prevents unauthorized data access
    - Ensures admin privileges work correctly
